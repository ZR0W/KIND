## about
chrome extension that aims to detect potentially harmful expressions and give the user a chance to reflect upon their choice of language.

## current problems
How to utilize jQuery with the extension?

Where should the bulk of the logic be?

April 14: background script is able to ececute inject.js. jQuery can be appended to the page but not my own scripts?

April 19: document.activeElement seems like a valid way to get the user input area across different websites (as pooposed to checking 'input' tag name). 

## comments
In order to make up for lost time in the semester, we are not using the background script for most of the logic, which I suspect may be prefered.
